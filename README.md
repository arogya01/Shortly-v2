## Shortly-v2 

Used Emotion and styled-system instead of styled-comp with a slight change in design. 

So, I got the basic gist of styled-system, where should I use it then, 

- for spacing 
- for background colors or colors in general 
- making responsive styles too. 
- some other stuff. 

ðŸ’¡ rather than using several different sorts of wrapper comps, I can create one box wrapper with pre-determined padding and margin.
